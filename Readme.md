# Materials about microservices

## Issues:
* Contract Driven Development
* Patterns

* Spring Cloud
* Jenkins Pipeline
* Creating docker images 
* Hystrix
* Apache Kafka?

## Spring Cloud:

## Falacies of distributed computing
[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing)

* The network is reliable
* Latency is zero
* Bandwidth is infinite
* The network is secure
* Topology doesn't change
* There is one administrator
* Transport cost is zero
* The network is homogeneous


## Stability design patterns 
* retry
* die
* circuit breaker 
* Hospital queue
* Rolback and leave
* Bulkhead
* Compensative transaction
* SAS - Scheculer Agent Supervisor
